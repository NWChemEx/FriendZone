Provides SimDE compatible APIs for packages existing outside the NWChemEx
ecosystem, *i.e.*, FriendZone lets NWChemEx play nicely with our friends.

   Existing packages come with a lot of different licenses. At the moment we
   only consider interfaces to packages that have licenses compatible with
   SimDE (and NWChemEx).
