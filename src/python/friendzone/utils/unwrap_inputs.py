def _compare_mol_and_point(mol, points, atol=1e-12, rtol=0.0):
    """
    Compare the 3D nuclear coordinates of a Molecule and a PointSet.

    This function is intended to ensure that gradient calculations
    are being performed at the correct molecular geometry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mol : chemist.Molecule
        The molecule whose nuclear coordinates are being compared.

    points : chemist.PointSet
        The point set to compare against (usually created from the molecule's nuclei).

    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance used by np.isclose. Default is 1e-12.
        This catches numerical noise due to Python/C++ floating-point boundary.

    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance used by np.isclose. Default is 0.0 (disabled),
        which ensures no scaling with magnitude â€” appropriate for comparing coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if all coordinate components match within the given tolerances.
        False otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Exact floating-point equality is not used because of small differences
    (e.g., ~1e-314) introduced by Python/C++ interoperability. These are
    not chemically meaningful and should be tolerated with a small `atol`.
