'''SimDE plugin designed to facilitate operations with packages outside the
SimDE ecosystem.

SimDE contains a series of standardized APIs for the field of computational
chemistry. Admittedly these standardized APIs are presently only used by
NWChemEx (and other projects developed by NWChemEx developers). FriendZone
bridges the gap by wrapping other computational chemistry packages in SimDE
compatible modules.
