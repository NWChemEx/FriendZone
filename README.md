FriendZone
==========

[Documentation](https://nwchemex.github.io/FriendZone)

Provides SimDE compatible APIs so that NWChemEx can play nicely with its 
friends, *i.e.*, this repo wraps existing electronic structure packages in
modules so they can be called as submodules in NWChemEx.

# Friends

Packages supported through FriendZone include:
- NWChem

# Warnings
Existing packages come with a lot of different licenses. At the moment we only 
consider interfaces to packages that have licenses compatible with 
[SimDE](https://github.com/NWChemEx/SimDE) (and 
[NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx/NWChemEx)).

Many of the other packages are by default configured/called suboptimally and 
thus the modules in this repo should **NOT** be used for direct timing 
comparisons unless otherwise noted. Performance contributions are greatly 
appreciated.

# Installation

As with the majority of the NWChemEx stack, FriendZone uses CMake and the 
[CMaize](https://github.com/CMakePP/CMaize) library for configuration and 
building. This means that installation is usually achieved via a variation on:

```.sh
git clone https://github.com/NWChemEx/FriendZone
cd FriendZone
cmake -H. -Bbuild -D...
cmake --build build --target install
```
More detailed install instructions can be found
[here](https://nwchemex.github.io/FriendZone/installation.html).
